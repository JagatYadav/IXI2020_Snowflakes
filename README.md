ML Analytics Model to Search More Personalized Opportunities

The analytical engine offers to scrape the entities automatically from websites on basis the recommended opportunities. This engine collects and analyzes data based on suggested content. 
And finally, data is then used to offer personalized and relevant content recommendations. 

Step1: Crawls websites and search for the opportunities
Step2: Build the recommendation model on the basis the above inputs data sets.
Algorithm
Alternating Least Squares matrix factorization: ALS estimate the ratings matrix R as the product of two lower-rank matrices, X and Y, i.e. X * Yt = R and these approximations are called 'factor' matrices. The general approach is iterative. During each iteration, one of the factor matrices is held constant, while the other is solved for using least squares. 
  
Collaborative Filtering
The task of Collaborative Filtering(CF) algorithm is to find an item likeliness.
The implicit data is used along with collaborative filtering. Collaborative filtering is
an algorithm that can start to learn for itself what features to use.

It is based on the assumption that a student A who is looking opportunitie in data analytics and student B have also been looking for same opportunitie . Then student A more likely to have an opinion common with student B on some random topic X than some other random student.
